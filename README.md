# Airbnb Replica using MERN currently working on it

This project is a full-stack web application that aims to replicate the core functionalities and user experience of Airbnb. It allows users to browse listings for accommodations, view detailed information, and potentially book stays (booking functionality might be a future enhancement).

## Technologies Used

This replica is built using the following technologies:

* **MERN Stack:**
    * **MongoDB** 
    * **Express.js** 
    * **React.js** 
    * **Node.js**
* **Bootstrap** 

## Features

This Airbnb replica currently includes the following features:

* **Browse Listings:** Users can view a list of available accommodations with key information like title, location, price, and a thumbnail image.
* **Detailed Listing View:** Clicking on a listing takes users to a dedicated page with comprehensive details, including:
    * Multiple images of the property.
    * Detailed description of the accommodation.
    * Amenities offered.
    * Pricing details.
    * Host information (basic details).
* **User Interface:** A clean and intuitive user interface inspired by Airbnb's design, built with React and styled with Bootstrap for responsiveness.
* **Responsive Layout:** The application is designed to be responsive and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices) thanks to Bootstrap's grid system and components.

## Potential Future Enhancements

The following features could be implemented in future iterations:
* **Search and Filtering:** 
* **Host Dashboard:** 
* **Reviews and Ratings:** Implement a system for guests to leave reviews and ratings for their stays.


* **Real-time Availability:** Implement real-time updates for listing availability.

## Getting Started (For Developers)

If you want to run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    * Update the MongoDB connection URI in your backend configuration file (e.g., `.env` file).

4.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (or `nodemon start` for development with hot-reloading)

5.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

6.  **Run the frontend development server:**
