# Airbnb Replica using MERN currently working on it

This project is a full-stack web application that aims to replicate the core functionalities and user experience of Airbnb. It allows users to browse listings for accommodations, view detailed information, and potentially book stays (booking functionality might be a future enhancement).

## Technologies Used

This replica is built using the following technologies:

* **MERN Stack:**
    * **MongoDB** 
    * **Express.js** 
    * **React.js** 
    * **Node.js**
* **Bootstrap** 

## Features

This Airbnb replica currently includes the following features:

* **Browse Listings:** Users can view a list of available accommodations with key information like title, location, price, and a thumbnail image.
* **Detailed Listing View:** Clicking on a listing takes users to a dedicated page with comprehensive details, including:
    * Multiple images of the property.
    * Detailed description of the accommodation.
    * Amenities offered.
    * Pricing details.
    * Host information (basic details).
* **User Interface:** A clean and intuitive user interface inspired by Airbnb's design, built with React and styled with Bootstrap for responsiveness.
* **Responsive Layout:** The application is designed to be responsive and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices) thanks to Bootstrap's grid system and components.

## Potential Future Enhancements

The following features could be implemented in future iterations:
* **Search and Filtering:** 
* **Host Dashboard:** 
* **Reviews and Ratings:** Implement a system for guests to leave reviews and ratings for their stays.


* **Real-time Availability:** Implement real-time updates for listing availability.

## Getting Started (For Developers)

If you want to run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bigyajeet/Airbnb_replica.git
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up MongoDB:**
    * Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
    * Update the MongoDB connection URI in your backend configuration file (e.g., `.env` file).

4.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (or `nodemon start` for development with hot-reloading)

5.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

6.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

7.  **Open in your browser:** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port your frontend is running on).

# Airbnb Replica using MERN and Bootstrap

This project is a full-stack web application that aims to replicate the core functionalities and user experience of Airbnb. It allows users to browse listings for accommodations, view detailed information, and potentially book stays (booking functionality might be a future enhancement).

## Technologies Used

This replica is built using the following technologies:

* **MERN Stack:**
    * **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store listing data, user information, and potentially booking details.
    * **Express.js:** A minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It handles the backend API and routing.
    * **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used to create a dynamic and interactive frontend experience.
    * **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that executes the backend server-side code.
* **Bootstrap:** A popular CSS framework used for responsive design and pre-built UI components. It helps in creating a visually appealing and consistent layout across different devices.

## Features

This Airbnb replica currently includes the following features:

* **Browse Listings:** Users can view a list of available accommodations with key information like title, location, price, and a thumbnail image.
* **Detailed Listing View:** Clicking on a listing takes users to a dedicated page with comprehensive details, including:
    * Multiple images of the property.
    * Detailed description of the accommodation.
    * Amenities offered.
    * Location information (potentially using maps integration).
    * Pricing details.
    * Host information (basic details).
* **User Interface:** A clean and intuitive user interface inspired by Airbnb's design, built with React and styled with Bootstrap for responsiveness.
* **Responsive Layout:** The application is designed to be responsive and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices) thanks to Bootstrap's grid system and components.

## Potential Future Enhancements

The following features could be implemented in future iterations:

* **User Authentication:** Implement user registration and login for guests and hosts.
* **Booking System:** Allow logged-in users to book accommodations for specific dates.
* **Search and Filtering:** Implement robust search functionality based on location, dates, number of guests, price range, and amenities.
* **Host Dashboard:** Create a dedicated dashboard for hosts to manage their listings (add new listings, edit existing ones, manage availability).
* **Reviews and Ratings:** Implement a system for guests to leave reviews and ratings for their stays.
* **Map Integration:** Integrate a map to display the location of listings visually.
* **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate a payment gateway to handle booking payments securely.
* **Real-time Availability:** Implement real-time updates for listing availability.
